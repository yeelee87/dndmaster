For example, the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute.\nThe chest regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the chest loses its magic (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust."

    "entries": "The Accounting and Valuation of All Things is bound in gold leaf, with pages of silver and text of blood.\nThis is a magic tome that functions as a spellbook and arcane focus. You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC.\n**Random Properties**：The Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property\n**The Soul Trade**：One section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations.\n**Mammon's Tax**：When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from True Resurrection. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse.\n**Negotiation Tactics**：The tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma (Persuasion) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer 6d6 necrotic damage.\n**Transcribed Spells**：The spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll (1d4 - 1). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would.\n**Destroying the Tome**：Destroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish.\nThe second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum."

There are symbols etched into its surface and there are six bezels that hold the Gems of Power.\nThe Amulet of Harmony has the following properties:\n• While attuned to this amulet, you feel a pull in the direction of the Prismatic Well.\n• If the Prismatic Well is dormant, you can restore its power by expending your own energy. You must be within 10-feet of the well to restore its power and you must say the words, \"I invoke the power of the Prismatic Well and restore the colors of Harmony for all.\" If you do so, roll a d6. On a 2-6, the power of the well is restored. On a 1, the well is restored but you fall into a deep, magical slumber for 1 year and cannot be roused except by a remove curse spell or similar magic.\n• You can turn off the power of the Prismatic Well, plunging all of Harmony into a polarized world where everything is horribly black and white. To do this, you must be within 10-feet of the well and you must say the words, \"I revoke the power of the Prismatic Well and withhold the colors of Harmony to all.\" If you do so, roll a d6. On a 3-6, the well is turned off. On 1-2, the power of the well remains and you turn into a statue of black stone.\nOnly a wish spell can undo this effect."

Hellfire ignores resistances and immunities to fire damage and deals double damage to creatures vulnerable to either fire or necrotic damage. It is also capable of melting stone, as well as igniting flammable objects.\n**Raging Inferno**：While attuned to the Amulet of the Inferno, you may use a bonus action to cast Fire Bolt or Produce Flame. The cantrips scale based on your total character level and use Intelligence as a spellcasting modifier if you're normally incapable of casting spells.\n**Everburning**：The Amulet of the Inferno grants resistance to cold damage and the ability to breathe underwater. Any magical flames you conjure are similarly augmented: they can be used underwater, can't be extinguished through any means, and can exude any temperature. While the casting of a fire spell can still be interrupted with Counterspell, once the spell has been cast, any lingering flames can't be removed.\n**Destroying the Amulet**：The only creature capable of destroying the amulet is the warlock that created it.

With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\nArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir.

Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\n**Magic Weapon**：The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness.\n**Random Properties**：The axe has the following randomly determined properties:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties\n**Blessings of Moradin**：If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\n• You have immunity to poison damage.\n• The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.\n• You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.\n**Conjure Earth Elemental**：If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental.

With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.\n**Destroying the Axe**：The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed."

Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.\n**Random Properties**：This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n**Properties of the Mortar**：The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.\n**Properties of the Pestle**：The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nThe pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n**Perfect Tools**：While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nYou can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.\n**Primal Parts**：As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.\n**Traverse the Night**：If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.\nYou don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.\n**Bones Know Their Home**：When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.\n**Destroying the Mortar and Pestle**：The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself."

    "entries": "The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see \"Personality\" below).\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\nThe staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges.\n**Power Strike**：When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.\n**Spells**：While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), hold monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges), lightning bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).\n**Retributive Strike**：You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\nYou have a 50 chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n[表格: ]\n**Animate Walking Statues**：You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statue of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n**Dispel Magic**：You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.\n**Drain Magic**：This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\n**Master of Enchantment**：When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\n**Sentience**：The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\n**Personality**：The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\nIn the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\n**Spirit Trap**：When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\nDestroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again."

It can hear within a range of 120 feet and has darkvision within a range of 60 feet, but it can't see anything behind itself.\nThe painting can converse in Common, Draconic, and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events, or any political conversations.\n**Personality**：Constantori's Portrait is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it from its gold-leaf frame.\n**Wealth of Information**：The painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past few decades, Constantori's Portrait has quietly observed countless conversations and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore—everything from criminal conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and what it doesn't.\nWhile attuned to the painting, you can take an action to telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are on the same plane of existence. The painting can't telepathically contact you, however. Maintaining telepathic contact with the painting requires your concentration (as if concentration on a spell).\n**Guardian Portrait**：While you are attuned to the painting, you can command it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or until your attunement to the painting ends.\nThe painting has 3 charges. When a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast magic missile (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\nThe painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs 15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a mending spell, it regains 2d6 hit points."

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.\n**Random Properties**：The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n**Spells**：The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.\n**Absolute Banishment**：While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.\n**Failing Matrix**：Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.\n**Iggwilv's Curse**：When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.\n[表格: Extraplanar Reversal]\n**Destroying or Repairing the Crook**：The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property."

    "entries": "The Crown of Horns contains the essence and intelligence of Myrkul, one of the Dead Three. This ghastly crown is a pale silver circlet with four curved bones set around its rim. On the crown's brow is set a black diamond whose depths swirl with weird, malignant energy.\nMyrkul created the Crown of Horns at the height of his power. When Myrkul was slain by Mystra, he imbued the crown with his dying essence. Myrkul has since returned to become one of the Dead Three, and the Crown of Horns continues to further his gruesome will by seeking out mortal agents and gradually transforming them into powerful Undead scions. Should a wearer prove unworthy of this honor, the crown teleports away to find a new mortal to corrupt for its master.\n**Cursed**：The crown is cursed. Attuning to the crown extends the curse to you. Only a Wish spell or the will of Myrkul can remove this curse. As long as you remain cursed, the following properties apply to you:\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Bound', 'entries': [\"You are unwilling to part with the crown, wearing it at all times, and you can't voluntarily end your {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to the crown.\"]}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Cruel', 'entries': ['Your alignment becomes Neutral Evil.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Doomed', 'entries': [\"You slowly transform into a monstrous servant of Myrkul over the course of 365 days. During that time, the transformation is purely cosmetic; these cosmetic changes slowly fade if you end {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to the crown before completing the transformation. When the transformation is complete, you become a {@creature Lich|XMM} under the DM's control. Each time you use this Artifact's {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone} of Undeath or Myrkul's Hand benefit, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that you instantly complete this transformation.\"]}\n**Cone of Undeath**：You can take a Magic action to unleash a wave of unholy light in a 60-foot Cone [Area of Effect]. Each creature in the Cone [Area of Effect] makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking (4d8) Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by Cone [Area of Effect] of Undeath rises at the start of your next turn as a Specter that follows your verbal orders.\n**Damage Immunity**：You have Immunity to Necrotic damage.\n**Fear Aura**：While wearing the crown, you emit an aura of terrifying energy in a 60-foot Emanation [Area of Effect]. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition. A Frightened target must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from you, moving by the safest route.\nIf you damage a Frightened target or if a Frightened target ends its turn more than 120 feet away from you, the target can repeat the Wisdom save, ending the condition on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the save against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.\nThe aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. You can activate or deactivate the aura as a Bonus Action.\n**Myrkul's Hand**：While wearing the crown, you can cast the Power Word Kill spell (save DC 18) from it. A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a Wraith that follows your verbal orders. Once you use the crown to cast this spell, you can't cast it again from the crown until the next dawn.\n**Teleportation**：While wearing the crown, you can cast the Teleport spell. The crown can also cast this spell of its own free will. Once the spell has been cast using the crown, it can't be cast again until 7 days have passed.\n**Random Properties**：The Artifact has the following random properties (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide):\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property\n**Sentience**：The Crown of Horns is a sentient Neutral Evil Artifact with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\nThe crown communicates telepathically with its wearer and knows Common.\n**Personality**：The crown contains the essence of Myrkul and exists to spread that god's will, which is to slay the living, raise the dead, and sow fear across the Material Plane. The crown urges its wearer to spread dread and destruction wherever possible.\n**Destroying the Crown**：The crown is destroyed if it is worn by Myrkul's successor, Kelemvor, while he sits on the throne of Myrkul's former realm, the Bone Castle."

As long as you remain cursed, you cannot discard the stone, which immediately teleports back into your pocket or pack. After you use the stone's magic, your next two ability checks are made with disadvantage."

The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.\nThe lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.\n**Random Properties**：The lantern has the following random properties:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n**Precious Fuel**：The lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.\nThe lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the \"Destroying the Lantern\" section).\n**Revealing Light**：The lantern sheds Vision and Light in a 60-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's Vision and Light.\nWhile attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to Vision and Light in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal Vision and Light radius.\n**Lenses**：When found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.\nAs an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save 20) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of Vision and Light. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.\n[表格: Lenses]\n**Destroying the Lantern**：To destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared."

These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)\nLike the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\nAs soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\nUnless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\nThe DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.\n[表格: Deck of Many More Things]\n**Aberration**：You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.\n**Beast**：You immediately transform into a random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.\nYou remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.\n**Book**：You gain the ability to speak, read, and write 1d6 + 2 languages of your choice.\n**Bridge**：You gain the ability to cast the Time Stop spell 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n**Campfire**：You immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.\n**Cavern**：You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.\n**Celestial**：You sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.\n**Construct**：A homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.\n**Corpse**：You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell.\n**Crossroads**：Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n**Door**：You gain the ability to cast the Gate spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n**Dragon**：A dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.\n**Elemental**：You become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n**Expert**：Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n**Fey**：A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.\nThe fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.\n**Fiend**：A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.\n**Giant**：You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.\n**Humanoid**：You can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.\n**Lance**：All your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n**Mage**：Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n**Map**：At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.\n**Maze**：You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion.\n**Mine**：A pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.\n**Monstrosity**：A Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.\n**Ooze**：A gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.\n**Path**：Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.\n**Pit**：A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition.\n**Plant**：You gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n**Priest**：Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n**Prisoner**：Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.\n**Ring**：A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.\n**Shield**：A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.\n**Ship**：You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.\n**Staff**：A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n**Stairway**：You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n**Statue**：You immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.\n**Tavern**：Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n**Temple**：A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\n**Tomb**：At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n**Tower**：Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\n**Tree**：Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n**Undead**：Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.\n**Warrior**：Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n**Well**：You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list."

But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.\nThis approach is particularly useful if you make a Deck of Many Things the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign.\nThis deck item comprises the following individual cards:\n• Balance Card\n• Comet Card\n• Donjon Card\n• Euryale Card\n• Fates Card\n• Flames Card\n• Fool Card\n• Gem Card\n• Jester Card\n• Key Card\n• Knight Card\n• Moon Card\n• Puzzle Card\n• Rogue Card\n• Ruin Card\n• Sage Card\n• Skull Card\n• Star Card\n• Sun Card\n• Talons Card\n• Throne Card\n• Void Card"

Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect.

With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally.

The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n**Comet**：If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n**The Fates**：Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n**Throne**：You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n**Key**：A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n**Knight**：You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n**Gem**：Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n**Talons**：Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n**The Void**：This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\n**Flames**：A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n**Skull**：You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n**Idiot**：Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n**Donjon**：You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n**Ruin**：All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n**Euryale**：The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n**Rogue**：A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n**Balance**：Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n**Fool**：You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n**Jester**：You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws."

In addition, the Monastery of the Distressed Body's brains in jars regard you thereafter as the monastery's rightful master. You must defeat or otherwise clear out the Grand Master and its servants before you can claim the monastery as yours.\n**Vizier**：At any one time you choose within the duration of the adventure, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n**The Void**：This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within machinery in either the control room of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M8) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. Divination, contact other plane, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the machinery that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.\nThe special nature of this deck (carried by Mary Greymalkin if she is used as an NPC) means that many of its effects operate only within and with respect to this specific adventure. This typically covers any time the characters spend between setting out for the Barrier Peaks and the resolution of whatever events transpire in Kwalish's lab (area O7).\nFor cards that effectively remove a character from play for a period of time (Donjon and the Void), you can allow a player to take on the role of one of the party's NPC hirelings, or introduce a temporary character as an NPC met during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character to operate in a robotic state until freed."

    "entries": "Created in the image of the Deck of Many Things, this deck of ivory or vellum cards bestows an assortment of minor benefits and penalties on those who draw from it. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw, then draw them randomly. Any additional cards drawn have no effect. Unless a card states otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\nUnless it is the Mystery card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\nYou can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck, as shown in the Deck of Wonder table.\n[表格: Deck of Wonder]\n**Beginning**：Your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10. Your hit point maximum remains increased in this way for the next 8 hours.\n**Champion**：You gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts for 8 hours.\n**Chancellor**：Within 8 hours of drawing this card, you can cast Augury once as an action, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n**Chaos**：You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.\n**Coin**：Five pieces of jewelry, each worth 100 gp, or ten gemstones, each worth 50 gp, appear at your feet.\n**Crown**：You learn the Friends cantrip. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you already know this cantrip, the card has no effect.\n**Dawn**：This card invigorates you. For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.\n**Day**：You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.\n**Destiny**：This card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.\n**Dusk**：This card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n**End**：This card is an omen of death. You take 2d10 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can't reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n**Isolation**：You disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for 1d4 minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.\n**Justice**：You momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n**Knife**：An uncommon magic weapon you're proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n**Lock**：You gain the ability to cast Knock 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n**Mischief**：You receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n**Monster**：This card's monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n**Mystery**：You have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.\n**Night**：You gain darkvision within a range of 300 feet. This darkvision lasts for 8 hours.\n**Order**：You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.\n**Student**：You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).\n**Vulture**：One nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the item isn't recovered within 1 hour, it disappears forever."

This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.\n**Blessing of the Deep**：If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Piety 10+', 'entry': 'You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet.'}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Piety 25+', 'entry': 'The bident has 1 randomly determined {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property.'}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Piety 50+', 'entry': 'The bident has 1 randomly determined {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property.'}\nIf you aren't a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property and 1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property, both randomly determined.\nSee \"Artifacts\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.\n**Command the Deep**：The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see \"Weather at Sea\" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal.

Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.\n**Aquatic Metamorphosis**：You can cast the true polymorph spell (save 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.\n**Destroying the Bident**：To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River."

The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.\n**Random Properties**：The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property\n**Spells**：The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha's hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges).\n**Abyssal Reference**：You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.\n**Fiendish Scourging**：Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.\n**Ensnarement**：While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.\n**Containment**：The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.\nWhen you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.\nWhen the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.\n**Destroying the Demonomicon**：To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows."

The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.\nThe low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.\nThose with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons—a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.\nWithin 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.\nFor any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence—because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.\nWhile the horn is sounding, a creature must make a 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone."

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

Nylea is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.\n**Bow of the Wild**：This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.\n**Blessing of the Wild**：If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Piety 10+', 'entry': 'The bow has 1 randomly determined {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property.'}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Piety 25+', 'entry': 'The bow has 1 randomly determined {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property.'}\nIf you aren't a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property.\nSee \"Artifacts\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.\n**Arrows of the Seasons**：The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Spring', 'entries': ['As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the {@spell awaken} spell for 8 hours.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Summer', 'entries': ['As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required.

The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox.

For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.\nOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.\nSome say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.\nTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\nTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\n**Random Properties**：The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties\n**Properties of the Eye**：Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n• You have truesight.\n• You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.\n• The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.\n**Properties of the Eye and Hand**：If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\n• You are immune to disease and poison.\n• Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.\n• You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.\n• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.\n• If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.\n• You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n**Destroying the Eye and Hand**：If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered."

The chair has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.\nThe sensation of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.\nWhile attuned to a flying citadel helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentration on a spell):\n• You can use the flying citadel helm to move the citadel through the air, up to 80 feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour.\n• You can steer the citadel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.\n• At any time, you can see and hear from the highest point outside the citadel as though you were at that location.\nIf no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless in its space.\n**Transfer Attunement**：You can use an action or a bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the flying citadel helm immediately, and your attunement to the flying citadel helm ends.\n**Crash**：Should the flying citadel helm be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300 feet per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

If there isn't enough space for the creature where it would appear, the figurine doesn't become a creature. The two forms are as follows:\n**Giant Canary Form**：The figurine becomes a giant canary for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn.\n**Gold Dragon Form**：While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can't use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can't be used this way again until 1 year has passed.\nIn either form, the creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each form. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the description."

For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.\nOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.\nSome say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.\nTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\nTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\n**Random Properties**：The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties\n**Properties of the Hand**：Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n• Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.\n• Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.\n• The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.\n**Properties of the Eye and Hand**：If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\n• You are immune to disease and poison.\n• Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.\n• You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.\n• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.\n• If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.\n• You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n**Destroying the Eye and Hand**：If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered."

When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.\nYou gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.\n**Diamond Light**：As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation [Area of Effect]. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation [Area of Effect] is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.\n**Fire Opal Flames**：As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The flames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.\n**Ruby Resistance**：As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.\n**Spells**：You can cast one of the following spells (save 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n**Taking Fire Damage**：Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot Emanation [Area of Effect] originating from you must succeed on a 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm."

Creatures and objects that fall overboard bob in a gravity plane that extends out from the main deck for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam.\n**Active Properties**：The sensation of being attuned to the helm is akin to being immersed in warm water. While attuned to the helm, you gain the following abilities while you sit in it:\n• You can use the helm to propel the vessel across or through water and other liquids at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot.\n• You can use the helm to propel the vessel through air or space at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot × 10.\n• Provided you have at least one unexpended spell slot, you can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the same way that oars or a rudder can maneuver a seafaring ship.\n• Whenever you like, you can see what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.\n**Drawback**：While attuned to the helm, you cannot expend your own spell slots."

According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven—or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.\nThe holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.\nThe holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.\n**Hold Vampires**：As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself.\n**Turn Undead**：If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.\n**Sunlight**：As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required)."

    "entries": "Iggwilv the Witch Queen crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\n**Attunement**：Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\nThree hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.\n**Random Properties**：Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property (determined by rolling on the Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property (determined by rolling on the Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\n**Gold Cauldron**：The gold cauldron has the following properties:\n• If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.\n• If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n• When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\n• Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n**Iron Cauldron**：The iron cauldron has the following properties:\n• You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n• If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n• Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.\n• If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.\n**Destroying the Cauldron**：The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.\nThe destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual).\n**Reconstructing the Cauldron**：If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.\nAs explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:\nEight cats perch atop eight dead attending\nEight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging\nEight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling\nEight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming\nEight eyes open, always dreaming\nAll on the cauldron that is ever seeming"

Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.\nWhen an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.\nA creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\"\n**Raising Structures**：You can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the mighty fortress spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\" Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings.\n**Connected Spaces**：You can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once.\n**Destroying a Keystone**：A keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a disintegrate spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.\nAfter it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over 1d12 + 1 days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over 1d20 + 10 minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.\nWhen a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the Stone of Creation is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.\nIf it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the plane shift spell), a keystone is destroyed.\n**Construction Details**：You can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine. You can also rearrange the floorplans and structural details of your creations as follows.\n**Demiplane Design**：With a single keystone, you can conjure an extradimensional space in the shape of a dome or pyramid, up to 1 mile on each side, with whatever terrain you wish. The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be invisible, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types.\nEach square mile can include a single structure up to the size of Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area.\nYou cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed.\n**Physical Structure Design**：With a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time.\nYou may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive Perception score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm.\n**Manifestations**：Each place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place. The DM may roll or choose from the following tables, or devise unique manifestations based on the specific creations being conjured."

It functions as a bag of holding and is available in a variety of colors and styles.\n[表格: Class-Based Living Loot Satchel]\nThe living loot satchel is a kind of magical being that safeguards the franchise's funds and valuables. Its innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office's vault in Waterdeep, to which the satchel periodically transfers the franchise's wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back to your satchel with a successful 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.\n**Secret Satchel**：As a rank 3 hoardsperson, your living loot satchel gets an upgrade to function as the replica chest used for the Leomund's secret chest spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can open the secret chest through your living loot satchel to deposit or withdraw items—even items that wouldn't normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head Office striking deals you don't want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don't want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end.\n**That Thing You Need**：At rank 3, you can use a bonus action to reach into your living loot satchel and make a 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on the Adventuring Gear table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. The item must be of a size that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15 gp. Once you attempt to draw five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn.\n**Portable Hole Satchel**：At rank 4, your living loot satchel receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic item. The secret chest accessed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a portable hole—6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized object into the portable-hole-sized chest, even if it wouldn't normally fit into your satchel.\n**That Expensive Thing You Need**：Also at rank 4, when you use your That Thing You Need feature, you can requisition any item of up to 250 gp in value, as long as it would fit into the confines of your satchel's portable hole."

Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.\nCreated by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarokka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.\nLike all Tarokka Deck, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.\n**Random Properties**：The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties properties\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n**Spells**：While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n**Enduring Vision**：While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.\n**Twist of Fate**：As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Weal', 'entry': 'The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.'}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Woe', 'entry': 'The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.'}\nThe deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.\n**Prisoners of Fate**：Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.\n[表格: Souls of the Tarokka]\nThe released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.\n**Shuffling Fate**：If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.\n**Destroying the Deck**：Luba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design.\n**Mother Luba and the Vistani**：The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.\nA halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. \"We may wander amid the shadows,\" Mother Luba said. \"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"\nSome years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice."

Carrying the boon of Asmodeus, it is fit for the most powerful servants of the Nine Hells.\n**Sentience**：The Mace of the Black Crown is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.\n**Personality**：A greedy erinyes named Xartaza lives within the Mace of the Black Crown. Xartaza wants to recruit more souls for Asmodeus, so the weapon pushes its wielder toward lawful evil actions by manipulating the wielder's dreams. A former Blood War general, Xartaza hates demons and relishes crafting sound battle plans in any conflict.\n**Dormant**：The mace grants the following benefits in its dormant state:\n• You can speak, read, and write Infernal.\n• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\n• While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace.\n• While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an imp. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\nThe Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property and one Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property and an additional Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property. See \"Artifact Properties\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

    "entries": "Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.\nTales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.\n**Dangerous Attunement**：Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.\nThe servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.\nAttuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.\n**Controlling the Servant**：While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.\nA creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have Cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.\nWhile you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:\n• Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)\n• Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)\n• As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.\n• When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.\nWhile there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.\n**Ghost in the Machine**：Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.\nIf the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.\n**Self-Destruct**：By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.\nIf the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.\nThis does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.\n**Destroying the Servant**：The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property."

Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.\nA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\nA moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.\n[表格: Moonblade Properties]\n**Sentience**：A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\nThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.\n**Personality**：Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.\nThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.\nIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals."

The sphere rapidly grows into a stout tower that remains until you use an action to touch the tower and speak the command word again, whereupon the tower shrinks back to a 1-inch-diameter granite sphere. The tower must be empty to shrink in this way. The tower bristles with muddy knobs that constantly extrude and retract across its surface, as though the tower were breathing through a coating of thick mud.\nEach creature in the area where the tower appears must make a 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\nWhenever it expands, the mudslick tower merges with any natural stone it touches, awkwardly tipping and wedging itself to touch as much natural stone as it can.\nThe tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\nAlthough it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points."

This isn't a power of the orb that you control.\n**Curse**：Any Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed:\n**Unconsciousness**：The cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n**Visions of Terror**：The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated.\nAfter either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a remove curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed.\n**Magical Signature**：As a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell detect magic reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way detect magic offers no further details about.\n**Destroying the Orb**：Murgaxor's orb has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters."

One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it.

Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n**Destroying an Orb**：An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however."

Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.\nThe Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.\nTo prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.\nRandom Properties. The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties\nThe random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.\n**The Sum of Its Parts**：Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:\n• The chronolometer\n• The dimensional loop\n• The far gear\n• The rotor of return\n• The timepiece of travel\n• The wheel of stars\nCreatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.\nWhile a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.\n**Future Echoes**：With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n**Into the Void**：With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.\n**Master of Travel**：While all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 17): contact other plane (3 charges), demiplane (6 charges), gate (7 charges), plane shift (5 charges), or teleportation circle (3 charges). The orrery regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn."

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

    "entries": "Powered armor resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material. The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings—only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor's left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal.\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:\n• You have a +1 bonus to AC.\n• Your Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher).\n• You have advantage on death saving throws.\nThe armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cell or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:\n• Emit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Fire arm-mounted laser: rw 8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. 命中：2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).\nThe armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.\nDepending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish's legendary powered armor.\n**Automatic Defenses**：Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit's automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a shield guardian that has stored a magic missile spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached.\n**Battle of Wills**：When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user's statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn't gain access to the user's knowledge, features, or proficiencies.\nFreeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time.\n**Stasis**：Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor's control.\n**Alternative Power**：Powered armor originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor's abilities."

The armor is powered by an energy cell stored in a compartment on the thigh plate.\nPlacing a full energy cell in the armor gives the armor 24 charges. A suit of powered armor functions as a suit of normal plate armor, even when it has 0 charges remaining.\n**Activating the Armor**：As an action, you can expend any number of the armor's charges to activate it; the armor remains active for 1 hour per charge expended. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the armor early, but doing so doesn't recover any expended charges.\nWhile the armor is active, you gain the following benefits:\n**Augmented Physicality**：You have advantage on Strength checks, and your carrying capacity is doubled.\n**Environmental Adaptation**：The armor seals airtight and provides its own atmosphere. You can breathe normally in any environment and withstand extreme temperatures, and you're unaffected by harmful gases, as well as contact and inhaled poisons.\n**Force Field**：When you would take damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to deploy a defensive force field. Roll 3d10 and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled.\n**Propulsion**：As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the armor's charges to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. If you're airborne when this duration ends, you fall.\n**Replacing the Energy Cell**：While the armor has charges remaining, its energy cell can't be removed. Once the armor has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action."

    "entries": "Artus Cimber has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.\nThe Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom.\n**Sentience**：The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.\n**Nondetection**：The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\n**Frozen Time**：As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost.\n**Cold Immunity**：While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide).\n**Magic**：The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:\n• You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.\n• You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).\n• You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.\n**Other Properties**：The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.\n**Destroying the Ring**：The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever."

Committed to the concept of law, the Wind Dukes descended from a people called the vaati, who once ruled many worlds. Seven Wind Dukes wove their power into an artifact called the Rod of Law.

It is a magic rod that functions as a morningstar and you have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. All damage dealt with it is converted to necrotic, and when you hit a good aligned creature, that creature takes an extra 2d12 necrotic damage.\nThe Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has 66 charges and regains 6d6 charges each nightfall. Asmodeus is always capable of perceiving through the rod and knows the exact location of any creature attuned to it. If a creature uses the special abilities of the rod without Asmodeus's permission, they take 2d12 necrotic damage each use, doubled if they're good aligned. This damage ignores resistances and immunities, and if it kills the user, Asmodeus permanently claims their soul.\n**Random Properties**：The Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has the following random properties:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties properties\nAsmodeus is immune to the detrimental properties of the weapon.\n**Bow to the King**：You may use an action to expend 33 charges to use the rod to force all creatures within a 150-foot-radius to bow to you. A creature must succeed on a 21 Charisma saving throw or be forced to kneel for up to 1 hour. Creatures immune to the charmed condition have advantage on their save. Each time a kneeling creature takes damage, they may repeat the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends early for kneeling creatures if they're touched by the Ruby Rod.\n**Acid, Cold, and Lightning**：At a cost of 9 charges each use, you may use an action to trigger one of the following effects:\n• You project acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d8 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n• You project an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 12d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n• You shoot lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n**Reactions**：As a reaction to suffering a detrimental effect, you may cast Lesser Restoration (expending 3 charges) or Greater Restoration (expending 12 charges.)\nAdditionally, if you're the sole target of a spell, you may use a reaction to attempt to use the rod to absorb the spell and cancel its effect. You roll 1d20 + 2, and if the result is higher than the spell level + 10, the spell is absorbed into the rod. The rod regains charges equal to the spell level it absorbed. If the absorbed charges go over the maximum of 66 charges, it overloads, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage per charge to you and expending all charges.\n**Destroying the Rod**：While Asmodeus lives, the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus can't be destroyed, and if attempted it simply returns to Asmodeus. If he were defeated, the rod could be destroyed by bringing it to the Abyss from whence it was created, then performing a ritual known only to Asmodeus."

If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a vampire spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes.\nAs a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.\nMarkovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.\nSuffused with confidence born of a righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.\nThe essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.\nMace of Disruption. When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage.

Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.\nWhile holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.\n**Sentience**：The Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:\n• The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.\n• The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.\n• The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast wall of fire from the shield (save 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n• Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn.\n**Gargauth's Personality**：Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.\nWhile trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.\nGargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.\n**Freeing Gargauth**：Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible."

If you already have darkvision, being attuned to the rapier increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet.\n• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\n• You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake.\n• While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.\nThe Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property and one Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property and an additional Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property. See \"Artifact Properties\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

    "entries": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.\nThe sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.\nWhile attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentration on a spell):\n• You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.\n• You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.\n• At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.\n**Transfer Attunement**：You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends.\nA spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.\nWildspace merchants, including dohwar and mercane (both described in Boo's Astral Menagerie), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more."

Etched into the skull's forehead is acererak rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death.\n**Beneficial Properties**：While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:\n• Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled.\n• You can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned.\n• Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.\n• You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit.\n**Invoke Curse**：The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A greater restoration, remove curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target.\n**The Forgotten One**：The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects Acererak from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a dispel evil and good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff.\n**Destroying the Staff**：A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess."

    "entries": "Rare legends and lore that speak of the Stone of Creation claim it fell to the Material Plane like a meteor from some distant edge of the Outer Planes or the Far Realm. Similar legends across various worlds, all describing stones that grow buildings and islands from magic, like a house from a seed, suggest the Stone of Creation is not a unique artifact—or that all the various pieces of it are derived from a single source of stone even larger than sages imagine.\nThe raw, black stone appears flaky like slate but is as hard as granite and marbled with veins of gold and platinum. The original, complete Stone of Creation took the form of a blocky slab like a standing stone, but it may be impossible to know the Stone's true size, or if the concept of a \"whole\" Stone of Creation even applies to the artifact. Perhaps other slabs and boulders made from the Stone have been scattered across the multiverse, being cut down and recombed through interplanar movements and the magic of the artifacts themselves.\n**Random Properties**：The Stone of Creation has the following random properties:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n**Stone Smithing**：While attuned to the Stone of Creation, you are proficient with mason's tools and can use them to cut pieces from the Stone's slab, thereby creating lesser artifacts.\n**Cut into Pieces**：The Stone of Creation is a source for smaller artifacts that derive their power from it. These pieces allow you to shape and bestow a portion of the slab's power for yourself or others.\nYou can cut pieces in two general sizes: a chip of creation or a keystone of creation. These lesser artifacts require their own attunement.\nUp to eleven chips of creation can be created from the existing slab, plus up to nine keystones. A chip resembles a flake of rock about the size of an adult human's hand. A keystone is at least five times that thickness.\nWhen all chips and keystones have been cut away, a portion of the Stone remains but proves impervious to additional attempts to cut or chisel pieces from it. This smallest version of the Stone is the same size as a Tiny creature.\n**Raze or Reshape Creations**：Although the Stone of Creation cannot create structures or demiplanes of its own, while you are attuned to it you can revise or renovate any structure or demiplane created by a keystone or chip, provided you are within 1 mile of the Stone and you can see or otherwise perceive the structure or demiplane. For example, you may add doors, seal windows, change the arrangement of rooms, or even dispel a structure created by a keystone. To do so, you must concentrate for 1 minute, as if on a spell, while picturing the changes you wish to make in your mind; over the course of that minute, the changes slowly occur. These changes cannot deal damage or directly harm a creature. A dispelled structure gradually recedes and diminishes to nothing, leaving creatures unharmed.\n**Destroying the Stone**：The Stone of Creation is a strange artifact that can be divided into smaller artifacts, yet the Stone is impervious to most damage. Only the smith attuned to the Stone can carve it. Destroying the Stone's lesser, derived artifacts (and their creations) does no damage to the Stone itself.\nThe Stone of Creation is destroyed if it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck with a forked metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the plane shift spell). The Stone then shatters into harmless, inert shards of rock. Places created by the slab's chips and keystones crumble, decay, or fade away to nothing after the Stone of Creation is destroyed. Whether the Stone of Creation is itself a piece of a larger artifact remains unknown."

    "entries": "The Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an aboleth named Golorr, transformed by magic into an object.\n**Random Properties**：The Stone of Golorr has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties\n**Legend Lore**：The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.\nBy using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.\nThe aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.\n**Failed Memory**：When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a greater restoration spell does so automatically.\n**Sentience**：The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.\nThe Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n**Personality**：The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\n**Destroying the Stone**：While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see."

    "entries": "When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.\nFor a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.\nThe Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.\nIf the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.\n**Random Properties**：The Sword of Kas has the following random properties:\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties\n• 1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties\n**Spirit of Kas**：While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.\n**Spells**：While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n**Sentience**：The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.\n**Personality**：The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.\nThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.\n**Destroying the Sword**：A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed."

The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see \"Shattering the Companion\"), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.\nIf Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword."

A creature attuned to the sword can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it without material components: fly (2 charges), polymorph (3 charges), or transport via plants (4 charges).\n**Sentience**：The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan.

Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created.

Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.\nNote: According to the SRD, it is an extra 4d6 slashing damage, although this is incorrect.\nIn addition, you can speak the sword's command to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.\n**Using the Teeth**：While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).\nIf you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).\nEach tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.\n[表格: Teeth of Dahlver-Nar]\n**Sowing Teeth**：To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.\n**Implanting Teeth**：To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.\n**Recovering Teeth**：Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.\n**Destroying the Teeth**：Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever."

    "entries": "This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.\nExplorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.\nThe Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.\n**Silver Wire**：The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an astral projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.\nAs long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an astral projection's silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.\nAny effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.\n**Summon Monster**：When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:\n• 1/day: conjure animals, summon lesser demons\n• 1/7 days: conjure minor elementals, conjure woodland beings, summon greater demon\n• 1/month: conjure elemental, conjure fey\n**Wish**：The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.\n**Random Properties**：There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.\nOnce set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.\n(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)\n**Destroying the Machine**：The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.\n[表格: Infernal Machine Properties]"

A single assistant (or more, at the DM's discretion) can help you conduct the ritual, so long as that assistant also meets the requirements to use the tome.\nTo create a dracolich using a Tome of the Dragon, you must have continuous access to the body of an adult or ancient dragon (either living or dead), as well as 80,000 GP worth of supplies (which includes a gem that will serve as the anchor for the dracolich's spirit). While you have the necessary materials, you must conduct a ritual that lasts 180 days divided by the number of creatures conducting the ritual. During the ritual, you and any assistants must work without interruption, resting no more than 8 hours per day. If you are a Dragon, the cost of supplies and the ritual's duration are halved.\nWhen the ritual is complete, the tome explodes with violet light, dealing (12d6) Necrotic damage to you and each assistant. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, the creature is killed and immediately reanimates as a Zombie under the DM's control.\nAt the end of the ritual, the target transforms into a Dracolich. If the ritual's target was a living dragon, that dragon dies instantly, and its spirit is transferred to the gem supplied for the ritual. If the target was a dead dragon's body, the body reanimates, and the gem is inhabited by an evil dragon spirit from the Outer Planes. The dracolich is under no obligation toward its creators and acts according to its nature."

While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to summon a projection of yourself in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of yourself. The projection is a translucent copy of you that has immunity to all damage and conditions, and you can make attacks and cast spells with a range other than self as if standing in the projection's space. The projection disappears at the end of your turn. Once you use this bonus action, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n**Curse**：This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you're unwilling to part with the armor. Taking it off fails to end the curse. While cursed in this way, you feel disconnected from your body, continuously hearing whispers that call for you to join them. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed, you must make a 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul is drawn from your body and trapped in an object on a different plane of existence. The object and location of this object are chosen by the DM (but might be the House of Cards; see chapter 18). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert and doesn't age or require sustenance. Destroying the object frees your soul; otherwise, only a Wish spell can restore your soul to your body."

For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.\nBathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss."

If a creature is vulnerable to a certain type of damage, all damage dealt with the staff is converted to that damage type. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra 3d6 fire damage.\nWhile holding the staff, you can control and navigate through the Iron Tower in Dis. While the staff is on the layer of Dis, Dispater knows the exact location of it, and is capable of teleporting to within 30 feet of it at will.\n**Random Properties**：The Wrought-Iron Tower has the following random properties:\n• 2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties.\n**The Best Offense**：While attuned to the staff, you have a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to all saving throws.\nAdditionally, the staff has 10 charges. When you make an attack, you may spend 1 or more charges. For each charge spent, you deal an additional 2 fire damage on a successful attack. Charges are still consumed if the attack misses. The staff regains all charges each day at dawn.\nAfter dealing damage with the staff, you may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to replace the damage dealt with your total AC instead.\n**Rulership**：The Wrought-Iron Tower also functions as a Rod of Rulership, with an increased save DC of 18.

An attuned creature must place the staff into the forge fires, then cast Dispel Evil and Good and touch the staff. They then take 20d10 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunities.

    "entries": "Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.\nAfter the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.\nAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.\nAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.\n**Properties of the Throne**：The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:\nThe throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.\nBoth the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.\nAs an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.\nAs an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.\nAs an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon bite and claw attacks.\n**Destroying the Throne**：The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.\nThe Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.\nAll creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:\n• While you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.\n• As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.\n• You can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the control weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails.\n**Touching the Mythallar**：Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save)."

If crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius sphere. A zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade, releasing its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed on a 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature's skin itches for the duration. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
