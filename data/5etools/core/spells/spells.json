If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes.

The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n**Redirect Flow**：You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain.

If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.\n**Set the Trigger**：You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n**Explosive Rune**：When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere [Area of Effect] centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n**Spell Glyph**：You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.\nWhen the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect.

The demiplane is your choice of a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or the like.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Minimus Containment', 'entries': ['The target becomes 1 inch tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gemstone or a similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through by any means.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Slumber', 'entries': [\"The target has the {@condition Unconscious|XPHB} condition and can't be awoken.\"]}\n**Ending the Spell**：When you cast the spell, specify a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that it has a high likelihood of happening within the next decade. The trigger must be an observable action, such as someone making a particular offering at the temple of your god, saving your true love, or defeating a specific monster.\nA Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the prison or the component used to create it.",

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\nA task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible.

A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.",

Each one is explained below.\n**Set the Trigger**：You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nOnce triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere [Area of Effect] with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere [Area of Effect] when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere [Area of Effect] for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.\n**Death**：Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.\n**Discord**：Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n**Fear**：Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n**Pain**：Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition for 1 minute.\n**Sleep**：Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake.\n**Stunning**：Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition for 1 minute.",

Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.\n[表格: Teleportation Outcome]\n**Familiarity**：Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:\n• \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.\n• \"Linked object\" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.\n• \"Very familiar\" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.\n• \"Seen casually\" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.\n• \"Viewed once or described\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\n• \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.\n**Mishap**：The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n**Similar Area**：You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.\n**Off Target**：You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.\n**On Target**：You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.",

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Object Creation', 'entries': [\"You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\"]}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Instant Health', 'entries': ['You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, and you end all effects on them listed in the {@spell Greater Restoration|XPHB} spell.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Resistance', 'entries': ['You grant up to ten creatures that you can see {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to one damage type that you choose. This {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} is permanent.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Spell Immunity', 'entries': ['You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.']}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Sudden Learning', 'entries': [\"You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.\"]}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Roll Redo', 'entries': [\"You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's {@variantrule Critical Hit|XPHB}. You can force the reroll to be made with {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} or {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB}, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\"]}\n• {'type': 'item', 'name': 'Reshape Reality', 'entries': [\"You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.\"]}\nThe stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",

You inscribe the detection glyph either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the detection glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nBoth glyphs are nearly invisible, and finding either requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nYou decide what triggers the detection glyph when you cast this spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the detection glyph, choose an alarm glyph or spell glyph to link to it.\n**Alarm Glyph**：You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. Each of these two glyphs must stay within 100 miles of the other or the spell effect ends. When the detection glyph is triggered, the effect glyph reacts like an alarm spell, creating a mental ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the effect glyph. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.\n**Spell Glyph**：You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. These two glyphs must be within 100 feet of each other. You can store a prepared spell of 4th level or lower in the effect glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyphs. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the detection glyph is triggered, the spell stored in the effect glyph is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on the effect glyph. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the effect glyph.

Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.",

The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.\nA small keep stands inside the enclosed area.

Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose.

The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.\nThe temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.\nThe temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.\nIn addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.\nFinally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).\nThe temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.",

The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.\n**Grasses and Undergrowth**：Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.\n**Trees**：At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.\n**Roots and Vines**：At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n**Rocks**：As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.",
